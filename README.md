##TASK DESCRIPTION: RESPONSIVE ECOBOTTLE LANDING PAGE

FOR THIS TASK, I HAVE DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED A RESPONSIVE LANDING PAGE FOR THE SMART WATER BOTTLE PRODUCT CALLED "ECOBOTTLE". THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS TASK WAS TO CREATE A USER-FRIENDLY, VISUALLY APPEALING, AND FULLY RESPONSIVE WEBPAGE THAT EFFECTIVELY SHOWCASES THE PRODUCT FEATURES AND PROVIDES EASY NAVIGATION FOR USERS.

I STARTED THE TASK BY STRUCTURING THE HTML LAYOUT INTO CLEAR SECTIONS INCLUDING HEADER, HERO SECTION, FEATURES, ABOUT, AND CONTACT. THE HEADER CONTAINS THE LOGO AND NAVIGATION LINKS TO ALLOW USERS TO QUICKLY ACCESS DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE PAGE. I ALSO ADDED A MENU ICON TO IMPLEMENT A MOBILE-FRIENDLY HAMBURGER MENU FOR SMALLER SCREENS.

THE HERO SECTION WAS DESIGNED TO CATCH THE USER’S ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY. IT INCLUDES A PROMINENT HEADLINE “STAY FRESH. STAY SMART.”, A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT, AND A CALL-TO-ACTION BUTTON LINKING TO THE FEATURES SECTION. I ADDED A HIGH-QUALITY IMAGE OF THE ECOBOTTLE USING THE LOCAL IMAGE PATH, AND ADJUSTED THE SIZE TO ENSURE IT LOOKS GOOD ON BOTH DESKTOP AND MOBILE DEVICES. THE HERO SECTION USES FLEXBOX TO ALIGN TEXT AND IMAGE SIDE BY SIDE ON LARGER SCREENS, AND STACKS THEM VERTICALLY ON SMALLER DEVICES.

FOR THE FEATURES SECTION, I CREATED THREE DISTINCT CARDS TO HIGHLIGHT THE PRODUCT BENEFITS INCLUDING SMART UV CLEANING, TEMPERATURE CONTROL, AND ECO-FRIENDLY DESIGN. EACH CARD IS STYLED WITH A BACKGROUND, BORDER RADIUS, AND SHADOW TO MAKE THEM STAND OUT. FLEXBOX WAS USED TO ARRANGE THE CARDS HORIZONTALLY, AND MEDIA QUERIES ENSURE THEY STACK VERTICALLY ON DEVICES WITH SMALLER SCREEN WIDTHS.

THE ABOUT SECTION PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ECOBOTTLE, EXPLAINING HOW IT MAKES LIFE SIMPLER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE. THE CONTACT SECTION IN THE FOOTER INCLUDES EMAIL, PHONE, AND SOCIAL MEDIA PROMPTS, MAKING IT EASY FOR USERS TO GET IN TOUCH.

TO MAKE THE PAGE RESPONSIVE, I USED CSS MEDIA QUERIES TARGETING SCREENS SMALLER THAN 768 PIXELS. THE NAVIGATION LINKS ARE HIDDEN BY DEFAULT ON MOBILE AND DISPLAYED USING A HAMBURGER MENU. THE HERO IMAGE AND FEATURE CARDS ARE SCALED APPROPRIATELY TO FIT SMALLER SCREENS WITHOUT DISTORTION OR OVERFLOW.

FINALLY, I ADDED A SIMPLE JAVASCRIPT FUNCTION TO TOGGLE THE NAVIGATION MENU WHEN THE HAMBURGER ICON IS CLICKED. THIS ENSURES THAT THE WEBPAGE REMAINS FUNCTIONAL AND EASY TO NAVIGATE ON MOBILE DEVICES.

IN SUMMARY, THIS TASK INVOLVED CREATING A CLEAN, MODERN, AND RESPONSIVE LANDING PAGE THAT SHOWCASES THE ECOBOTTLE PRODUCT EFFECTIVELY. I USED HTML FOR STRUCTURE, CSS FOR STYLING AND RESPONSIVENESS, AND JAVASCRIPT FOR INTERACTIVITY. THE FINAL PAGE IS USER-FRIENDLY, VISUALLY APPEALING, AND FULLY RESPONSIVE, PROVIDING AN EXCELLENT USER EXPERIENCE ACROSS ALL DEVICES.
